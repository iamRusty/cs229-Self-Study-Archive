# cs229 Self-study Guide
Lecture videos used are from the cs229 2008 class. All other course materials are up-to-date. 
The original cs229 course uses Matlab/Octave for hands-on exercise. You can use [Coursera materials](ml-class.org) for the exercises.
With the passing years, machine learning implementation in python has gained traction. Exercises in Python skeleton are available [here](https://www.johnwittenauer.net/machine-learning-exercises-in-python-part-1/)
### Lecture 1
Skip this unless you really don't have an idea of what is machine learning and what are the general groups of machine learning algorithms.

### Lecture 2
* Covers page 1 to 11 of Lecture Note 1
* Knowledge in Matrix operations and Vector Calulus is needed
* The normal equations part could be generalized with pseudoinverse inverse matrix operations, particularly, Moore-Penrose inverse.

### Lecture 3
Knowledge acquisition in progress.

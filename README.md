# cs229 Self-study Guide
Lecture videos used are from the cs229 2008 class. All other course materials are up-to-date. 

### Lecture 1
Skip this unless you really don't have an idea of what is machine learning and what are the general groups of machine learning algorithms.

### Lecture 2
* Covers page 1 to 11 of Lecture Note 1
* Knowledge in Matrix operations and Vector Calulus is needed
* The normal equations part could be generalized with pseudoinverse inverse matrix operations, particularly, Moore-Penrose inverse.

### Lecture 3
Knowledge acquisition in progress.
